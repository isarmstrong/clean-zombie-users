clean-zombie-users
==================

Damn zombie users! Always eating your MySQL database. This WordPress plugin cleans up all sorts of users, especially spammy ones. Braaaaaains. Target specific user roles for deletion if they have never posted, commented, or done either. Includes a test mode and chunking for large sites.
